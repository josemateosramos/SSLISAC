# Semi-Supervised End-to-End Learning for Integrated Sensing and Communications

## Getting Started
This code is based on [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) 1.12.1 and CUDA 11.3.1, and may not work with other versions. For more information about how to install these versions, check the [Pytorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/#v1121).

The simulation parameters to train and test different scenarios are located in the `simulation_parameters.py` file within the `lib/` directory. After that, the `methods` folder contains the scripts to train and test all the methods.
